	<summary>A GTK3 hierarchical markdown notetaking application with tablet support</summary>
	<description>
		<p>
			This program is a structured notetaking application based on GTK+ 3.
			Write your notes in instantly-formatted Markdown, organise them in a
			tree of folders that can be instantly navigated from within the
			program, and add hand-drawn notes by mouse, touchscreen or
			digitiser.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Why?</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			I figured it would be nice to have a free-software,
			platform-independent OneNote. While there is a remarkable number of
			free (speech or beer) notetaking applications out there, to my best
			knowledge, none of them simultaneously check the following boxes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>note organisation</li>
			<li>text as a first-class object</li>
			<li>formatting</li>
			<li>simple, standard on-disk format</li>
			<li>tablet input</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<em>Usage notes</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Note management
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create a new note, doubleclick a <code>+</code> node in the tree view and enter a name.</li>
			<li>To create a new <em>folder</em>, doubleclick a <code>+</code> node in the tree view and enter a name ending in <code>/</code>, e.g. new <code>folder/</code>.</li>
			<li>Notes will be sorted alphabetically.</li>
			<li>You can move notes and whole folders between folders by dragging and dropping.</li>
			<li>Files are saved automatically when the window is closed, when a different file is opened, and after a timeout when no user action is performed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Markdown
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some markdown features are unsupported as a stylistic choice or because of parser limitations. If you are feeling adventurous, you can adjust the markdown parser by editing the GtkSourceView language definition in <code>sourceview/markdown.lang</code>.</li>
			<li>Add LaTeX math using single <code>$</code> signs, e.g. <code>$\int x dx$</code>.</li>
			<li>Some markdown will be hidden ("rendered") unless your cursor is next to it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note management
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drawings can currently only be deleted whole. (This will be fixed eventually.)</li>
			<li>To edit the default colour palette, right-click any of the colour buttons on the right-hand toolbar.</li>
			<li>Due to present limitations, drawing clears the undo stack.</li>
			<li>When copypasting text into other applications, drawings will be automatically converted into data URL PNGs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note management
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The program loads a custom Gtk+ stylesheet found in <code>data/stylesheet.css</code>. Clear it if parts of the UI look wonky.</li>
			<li>If something unexpected happens, it is often useful to run the program from a terminal and look at stdout.</li>
		</ul>
